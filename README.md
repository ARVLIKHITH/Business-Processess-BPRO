# Business Processes & ERP Simulation (BPRO Project)

This repository documents my **BPRO (Business Processes) project**, where the main objective was to **simulate the entire lifecycle of a product** in three different ways:  

1. **BPMN Schema** â€“ Modelling the process flow of the company  
2. **AP Plus ERP** â€“ Structuring master data and simulating digital manufacturing  
3. **SAP S/4HANA** â€“ Executing the same processes across multiple integrated ERP modules  

The project was designed to bridge **business understanding and technical ERP execution**. This project was carried out as part of the BPRO module under the guidance of Technische Hochschule WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt (FHWS) faculty. 
We were required to contact a Manufacturing company, obtain real data about one product, and then transform this into digital processes across the platforms.  

---

## Project Assignment & Structure

- **Step 1 (Company Contact):** Approach a Manufacturing company and select one product.  
- **Step 2 (Data Collection):** Gather process-related data, including raw materials, production stages and procurement details.  
- **Step 3 (BPMN):** Model the entire product lifecycle digitally using BPMN.  
- **Step 4 (APplus ERP):** Enter the master data, create routings, simulate orders, and compare costs digitally.  
- **Step 5 (SAP S/4HANA):** Rebuild the same data and processes inside SAP across MM, PP, WM, and FI modules.  

This ensured that we didnâ€™t just learn ERP software but also understood **how businesses actually run their operations** and how ERP captures that in a structured way.

## Company Background â€“ Vahini Pipes

I collaborated with **[Vahini Irrigation Pvt. Ltd.](https://vahinipipes.com/)**, a manufacturing company in India that specialises in **HDPE pipes for irrigation and water systems**.  

- **Industry:** Manufacturing & Irrigation Systems  
- **Technology Used:** Extrusion, Cooling, Cutting, Packaging, Quality Testing  
- **Chosen Product:** **HDPE Pipe**  
- **Reason for Selection:**  
  - Full supply chain involvement (raw materials â†’ extrusion & machining â†’ packaging â†’ quality â†’ delivery).  
  - Offers complexity in procurement and production, making it ideal for ERP modelling.  

This company context provided a **real foundation** to carry the product data across BPMN, AP Plus, and SAP.

## BPMN (Process Modelling with Camunda)

The first part of the project focused on **Business Process Modelling** using **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**.  
The task was to **design a digital schema** that outlines every key step in the lifecycle of the product â€“ from **procurement of raw materials** to **final customer delivery**.  

I used **Camunda Modeller** to build the BPMN diagram, and I also created a **Process Profile** (document) that defined all the process inputs, outputs, suppliers, and customers.  

---

### Subsection 1: Story of BPMN Work

- **Objective:** Model the real-life processes of Vahini Pipes digitally.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Identified all raw materials and suppliers.  
  - Mapped out each production stage (Extrusion, Cooling, Cutting, Packaging, Quality, Labelling, Processing).  
  - Added procurement processes (purchase orders, goods receipt, invoice verification).  
  - Added sales processes (customer orders, deliveries, invoicing).  
- **Outcome:**  
  - A complete **BPMN schema** was developed.  
  - It represented the **end-to-end integration of procurement, production, quality, warehousing, and customer delivery**.  
  - Supported by a **Process Profile** with performance metrics (time, yield, costs, customer satisfaction).  

This was the **foundation of the BPRO project**, ensuring the rest of the work in APplus and SAP followed the same logic.

### Subsection 2: Process Profile & BPMN Schema

ðŸ“‚ Files included:  
- ðŸ“‚ [Process Profile Report (PDF)](./Process%20Profile.pdf) â†’ Full Process Profile (inputs, outputs, suppliers, customers, metrics).  
- ðŸ“‚ BPMN schema created with Camunda Modeller.
  
 ![BPMN Schema](./BPMN%20Schema%20(HDPE%20Pipe).png) 
 
- ðŸ“‚ [Process Improvement Presentation (PDF)](./Process%20Improvement.pdf) â†’ Proposed process improvements to further optimise production workflows and minimise material waste.

# AP Plus ERP

The second part of the BPRO project focused on **APplus ERP**, where I digitally structured and simulated the production of HDPE pipes.  

This phase emphasised **master data creation, order management, costing, and machine scheduling**.  
Unlike SAP, APplus is designed to show process data in a more **visual and planning-oriented way**, with Gantt charts and efficiency targets.  

---

## Story of AP Plus Work

- **Objective:** Build the digital backbone of the company (Vahini Pipes) by entering all **master data** and simulating its operations.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Created all **materials, BOMs, routings, work centres, and machines**.  
  - Structured **customer master data, vendor data, and pricing**.  
  - Entered multiple **customer orders** and triggered procurement for raw materials.  
  - Monitored digital manufacturing flow through APplus dashboards.  
  - Analysed **planned vs. target cost** to track efficiency.  
- **Challenge:**  
  - At the end of the project, all machines had to reach **80% utilisation**.  
  - To achieve this, I carefully scheduled orders in the **Gantt chart**, balancing workloads and timing to ensure each machine reached the 80% efficiency threshold.  
- **Outcome:**  
  -  Achieved machine utilisation targets across all work centres.

  -  Demonstrated Comparative costing for the final product with the customer order AB1000002.

## SAP S/4HANA

The third and final part of the BPRO project involved executing the processes in **SAP S/4HANA**.  
This part was more advanced, as I had to work across **multiple integrated modules**:  

- **MM (Materials Management)** â€“ Vendors, purchase orders, invoice verification  
- **PP (Production Planning)** â€“ BOM, routings, work centers, production orders  
- **WM (Warehouse Management)** â€“ Goods receipts, goods issues, storage locations  
- **FI (Financial Accounting)** â€“ Invoices, payments, and financial postings  

---

### Story of SAP Work

After structuring data in APplus, the same logic was replicated in SAP.  
I created all relevant master data, processed procurement, and ran the complete **sales-to-billing cycle**.  

- **Challenge:** Instead of machine utilisation like in APplus, here I had to achieve **80+ confirmations**, one generated from each routing.  
- Result: Successfully completed more than **80 confirmations**, ensuring that production, routing, and costing processes were validated.

### Confirmations & Production Orders

- Generated and confirmed **80+ production order confirmations**.  
- Used **CO11N** to enter time tickets for each routing step.  
- Adjusted planned vs actual times for realistic confirmation data.  
- Linked production orders with **Goods Issues (GI)** and **Goods Receipts (GR)**.
  
**Summary:**

- Each routing step in production required a **confirmation**.  
- Confirmations validated the execution of:  
  - Setup time  
  - Processing time  
  - Labour time  
  - Goods issues/receipts
    
In SAP:  
- Focus was on **number of confirmations**.  
- Target: At least **80 confirmations** (1 per routing step).  
- Completed **125 confirmations** successfully.
