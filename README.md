# Business Processes & ERP Simulation (BPRO Project)

This repository documents my **BPRO (Business Processes) project**, where the main objective was to **simulate the entire lifecycle of a product** in three different ways:  

1. **BPMN (Camunda)** – Modelling the process flow of the company  
2. **APplus ERP** – Structuring master data and simulating digital manufacturing  
3. **SAP S/4HANA** – Executing the same processes across multiple integrated ERP modules  

The project was designed to bridge **business understanding and technical ERP execution**.  
We were required to contact a real company, obtain real data about one product, and then transform this into digital processes across the platforms.

## 📖 Project Assignment & Structure

- **Step 1 (Company Contact):** Approach a real company and select one product.  
- **Step 2 (Data Collection):** Gather process-related data including raw materials, production stages, procurement, and customer details.  
- **Step 3 (BPMN):** Model the entire product lifecycle digitally using BPMN.  
- **Step 4 (APplus ERP):** Enter the master data, create routings, simulate orders, and compare costs digitally.  
- **Step 5 (SAP S/4HANA):** Rebuild the same data and processes inside SAP across MM, PP, WM, and FI modules.  

This ensured that we didn’t just learn ERP software but also understood **how businesses actually run their operations** and how ERP captures that in a structured way.

## 🏢 Company Background – Vahini Pipes

I collaborated with **[Vahini Irrigation Pvt. Ltd.](https://vahinipipes.com/)**, a manufacturing company in India that specialises in **HDPE pipes for irrigation and water systems**.  

- **Industry:** Manufacturing & Irrigation Systems  
- **Technology Used:** Extrusion, Cooling, Cutting, Packaging, Quality Testing  
- **Chosen Product:** **HDPE Pipe**  
- **Reason for Selection:**  
  - Full supply chain involvement (raw materials → extrusion & machining → packaging → quality → delivery).  
  - Offers complexity in procurement and production, making it ideal for ERP modelling.  

### 🔹 Process Inputs
- Raw Materials: Resin H829, Impact Modifiers (FM50, B564), Titanium, Wax (Inner/Outer), Acrylic Resin, Ink, UV Stabiliser, Oil, Plastic, Paper, Water.  
- Quality Standards: ISO 4427 (Polyethylene Pipes), ISO 9001 (QMS).  

### 🔹 Process Outputs
- **Planning Outputs:** Sales order confirmations (SAP), Master Production Schedules (APplus).  
- **Products:** HDPE pipes manufactured, packaged, labelled, and stored for delivery.  
- **Quality Reports:** Certified QA and third-party test reports.  
- **Customers:** Rohr GMBH, BAUG, Tech GMBH, Mahalakshmi Pvt. Ltd, Studentenwerk Pvt., and others.  

This company context provided a **real foundation** to carry the product data across BPMN, APplus, and SAP.

## 🔄 BPMN (Process Modelling with Camunda)

The first part of the project focused on **Business Process Modelling** using **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**.  
The task was to **design a digital schema** that outlines every key step in the lifecycle of the product – from **procurement of raw materials** to **final customer delivery**.  

I used **Camunda Modeler** to build the BPMN diagram, and I also created a **Process Profile** (document) that defined all the process inputs, outputs, suppliers, and customers.

### 🔹 Subsection 1: Story of BPMN Work

- **Objective:** Model the real-life processes of Vahini Pipes digitally.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Identified all raw materials and suppliers.  
  - Mapped out each production stage (Extrusion, Cooling, Cutting, Packaging, Quality, Labelling, Processing).  
  - Added procurement processes (purchase orders, goods receipt, invoice verification).  
  - Added sales processes (customer orders, deliveries, invoicing).  
- **Outcome:**  
  - A complete **BPMN schema** was developed.  
  - It represented the **end-to-end integration of procurement, production, quality, warehousing, and customer delivery**.  
  - Supported by a **Process Profile** with performance metrics (time, yield, costs, customer satisfaction).  

This was the **foundation of the BPRO project**, ensuring the rest of the work in APplus and SAP followed the same logic.

### 🔹 Subsection 2: Process Profile & BPMN Schema

📂 Files included:  
- `docs/Process_Profile.pdf` → Full Process Profile (inputs, outputs, suppliers, customers, metrics).  
- `docs/BPMN_Schema.png` → BPMN schema created with Camunda Modeler.  

The Process Profile defined:  
- **Inputs:** BOM, customer sales order, raw materials, quality requirements.  
- **Outputs:** Sales order confirmations, production schedules, QA reports, packaged HDPE pipes.  
- **Objectives & Metrics:**  
  - Process time: 2 hours/piece  
  - FPY (First Pass Yield): 99%  
  - Cost per unit: €20.65  
  - Scrap rate: <3%  
  - Customer satisfaction: ≥4.5/5  
  - On-time delivery: 95% target  

The BPMN schema visually represented:  
- Procurement workflow → Sales workflow → Production workflow → Quality → Delivery.  

*(I will add the actual BPMN schema and process profile images in this section)*

✅ Up to here, you now have:  
- **Intro** (how project was assigned)  
- **Company info (Vahini Pipes)**  
- **BPMN section** with story + subsections for Process Profile & Schema

👉 Next, we’ll continue with **APplus (story + content + challenges + tables)** and then **SAP (modules + story + tables)**.  

Do you want me to go ahead and **draft the APplus section next**, in the same detailed “story + data + tables” format?
